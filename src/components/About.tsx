              I started my professional life as a biomedical scientist. After
              working with diagnostics in the laboratory, I felt I wanted a
              bigger challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              My work as a biomedical scientist included a lot of technology and
              robotics handling that I was drawn to. The interest in
              problem-solving has always been with me, which, along with my
              curiosity about how things work technically, led me to start my
              education: Software Development and Operations at Linnaeus
              University.

              During my studies, I used Java, JavaScript, Node.js, C#. I was
              introduced to DevOps and got to try Ansible, CI/CD, Docker,
              Kubernetes.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned SQL and got to work with databases such as SQLite,
              MySQL, and MongoDB. We also ran OpenStack and got to set up
              infrastructures and work with servers. GitHub was used throughout
              the entire education period.
            </p>
            <p>
              We got to work both in groups and individually. When we did group
              work, we worked agilely with Scrum.

              After my education, I started working as a consultant. I gained
              experience in web development and microservices using Spring Boot
              through projects.

              Other technologies I gained experience with included React, React
